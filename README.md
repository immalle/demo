## Linking to line numbers on Github

Example link:

https://github.com/immalle/demo/blob/5c6ac6437718b5a9c2fd8b1fca157534f8148aa8/test.js#L1

Create a link like this by clicking on the number when viewing the file in Git:

This doesn't work for `.md`-files (like this `README.md`) because they have a different viewer (which parses the Markdown-code).
