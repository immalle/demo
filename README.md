# Demo

This repo demonstrates some git and GitHub-features.

- [Linking to files in GitHub](linking.md) : use `Y` to link to a specific
  version of a file, not just the latest `master`-branch
- [Linking to line numbers](linenumbers.md) : use `shift` for ranges and
  keep in mind `.md`-files are parsed to HTML
  <strong style="background-color:red;color:yellow">new</strong>
- [Linking to subdirectories](relative_links.md) : GitHub supports **relative
  paths** to files in your repo. Opening a folder views `README.md` by default
  (compare with `index.html`).
